          Equipped is a video & photography equipment management application, 
          meant to help film collectives, media companies, or rental houses 
          keep track of all their equipment. A user can browse a catalog of items 
          and stash the ones they own into their company inventory. There is a feature 
          that allows you to see who has what piece of equipment checked out, along with 
          a history of the usage. There is also a message board that can utilized.

          I made this app after thinking about my time working for a small media company that
          could have used an equipment manager. This application would have been a good aid for keeping track 
          of who was using what and when.
